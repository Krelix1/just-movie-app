Single web page application for searching films, made with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to show small part of my skills.
##`react`
Used as a main library to create my SPA.
##`redux`
Used for a state management
##`react-router-dom`
Used for a routing in app
##`axios`
Used for making http requests
##`redux-thunk`
Used for async actions
##`react-css-modules`
Used for styling components
###[TheMovieDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)
Used for getting movies
###[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
Used for authentication, storage of the language selected by the user and hosting the app
##And other
...approaches (as a `pure function`,`hooks`,`...`) you can see in my app, just look in :)

P.S. I'm junior front-end developer, so i can make some `new Error` or can use outdated approaches, but i want to become better and i hope you wil help me!
